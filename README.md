**FEW** is a **Feature Engineering Wrapper** for sci-kitlearn. FEW looks for a set of feature transformations that work best with a specified machine learning algorithm in order to improve model estimation and prediction. In doing so, FEW is able to provide the user with a set of concise, engineered features that describe their data.
